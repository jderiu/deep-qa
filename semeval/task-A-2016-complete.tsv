638483270355812352	neutral	If DDG is stuck here till Jan, can we offer him to Barca just to annoy Madrid even more.
638483514850193408	neutral	Madrid and Barca run the La Liga, not a chance DDG won't be a Madrid player by tomorrow.
638488377340223489	neutral	Of course it will be, When Barca can sign a player inspite being banned from signing, Why not Real get 1 minute. https://t.co/c6kXXMyfFb

629336789749141504	neutral	@MilanEye I didn't buy your club to invest in Zlatan. I shall visit China tomorrow &amp; gift you a china-made zlaCHAN  8) #Taekwondo #staycalm
629344022163755008	neutral	@MrTransferNewss @FootbaIISources considering I'm 31st, it looks like Zlatan's about to disappear.
629786702052241408	neutral	Zlatan's 20th goal of the season not enough for who concede twice late on to draw 2-2 with Caen...

630817148751978496	neutral	@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway.
630820977346150400	negative	Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable.
631192740089311232	neutral	@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?
632489375708905472	neutral	@Paulkurth that 3rd shot looks like its from a Michael Bay movie. Zlatan just revealed himself to be Optimus prime.
632604790720217089	negative	@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap.
632806342382653440	positive	7 more days till we start the campaign that will win us our 19th scudetto ! Zlatan or no Zlatan that trophy is ours. #ForzaMilan

634847150510227460	neutral	Sun are so full of shit they say PSG trying to replace Zlatan with Neymar hahaha
635032745241112576	positive	Reserving the right to put Milan 3rd if Zlatan arrives
635166727651856384	positive	Zlatan is simply saving himself for the 2nd leg
635179934365941760	positive	@DaveEllis11 @klavierstuk but if Zlatan is available for a reasonable fee, it may well be worth going for, for an immediate solution.
635220412155105280	neutral	@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
635924485753991169	negative	The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan)
636025757672820736	positive	I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal
636255247992758272	neutral	@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore
636980439622684672	positive	Mourinho, Zlatan, Serie A - who are the winners and losers from the CL draw?: Thursday's ceremony in ... http://t.co/nnVgvDwUvk #RETWEET

637711360416198656	neutral	@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin. Obviously prefer Zlatan, muller, Lewandowski etc #mufc
637722964432146432	neutral	We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news
638013292036923392	neutral	Zlatan is looking mighty attractive at the moment,if LVG doesn't get a striker by Tuesday, I really don't fancy us scoring goals this season
638018562334916609	positive	Wonder if Zlatan will be a United player come Tuesday night, think he may be the only realistic option of a big name signing.
638033582112534529	negative	Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze
638090040254574592	negative	If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!
638405789993017344	neutral	If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break.

639016598477651968	neutral	@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price
640276909633486849	neutral	Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
640296841725235200	neutral	Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ
